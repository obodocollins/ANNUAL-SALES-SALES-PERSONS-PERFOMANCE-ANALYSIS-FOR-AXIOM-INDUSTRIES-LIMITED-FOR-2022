This is a sales and salespersons analysis for Axiom Industries for the year 2022.
The goal of the analysis is to uncover sales trends and salespersons' performance for the year in review.
The tool used for this analysis are Microsoft Excel and Power Query for data cleaning. The skills employed are: data visualization, data cleaning, and strategic evaluation.
After the data was obtained, it was subjected to some sense of cleaning before the evaluations and analysis were done.

At the end of the analysis, the following insights and observations were made from the dashboard developed.

1. The best-selling region is the northern region

2. The best salesperson for the year is Nancy Freehafer.

3. The best city by sale is York City.

4. The best-performing customer for the year is company D.

5. The highest-selling product for the year is coffee.

6. The highest sales month is December.

7. The least performing product category is chocolate biscuit mix and it was sold only in the northern and eastern regions.

To boost sales and improve the performances of salespersons, the following recommendations should be implemented:

1. The best salesperson and best-performing product as well as the best-performing customer was observed to be in the north.
   Thus it is recommended that the products sold in the north should also be sold in the other regions with less performance.

3. The least sales person was observed to be selling well below three product categories with just a customer base.
   More product categories should be sent to that region and also ensure that the categories of products to be sent are among the best-performing categories (Coffe).

4. It was further discovered that the least performing city also has limited product categories and passive salespersons.
    More product categories should also be included in the product categories.


6. The month with the least sales is January. This is almost normal globally as customers are just recovering from expenditures from the festive season. To boost sales this time, strong incentives should be set to encourage sales.
